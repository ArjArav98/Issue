# Issue
It can sometimes be _frustrating as hell_ to switch to your browser from your IDE or terminal to view task requirements. It can be even more irritating when these websites don't have proper keyboard support.

To combat all this, **Issue** is a simple CLI utility for viewing and marking GitLab project issues _(Support for Jira, Github and Clubhouse coming soon!)_.

   |Linux ARM64| [Download](https://github.com/ArjArav98/Issue/raw/master/dist/linux_arm64/issue) |
   |Windows 386| [Download](https://github.com/ArjArav98/Issue/raw/master/dist/windows_386/issue.exe) |
   |Windows AMD64| [Download](https://github.com/ArjArav98/Issue/raw/master/dist/windows_amd64/issue.exe) |

* Add the path of the directory, in which the executable is present, to your `PATH` environment variable.
* Run `issue version` to verify the successful installation!

### Initial Setup
* Run `issue init`.
* Open the generated `issues.config.json` file.
  * [Generate a Gitlab API token.](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens) Only provide read_* permissions to the token. Paste your token as the value for the `BearerToken` attribute in the config file.
  * The value for the `HostUrl` attribute must be the full domain URL at which Gitlab is hosted for you (ex; `https://mycompany.com/gitlab` or `https://gitlab.mycompany.com`). If you are using the cloud (normal) version of Gitlab, use `https://gitlab.com`.
  * The value for the `RepositoryNamespace` attribute must be the repository name (ex; ArjArav98/Issue or stark-industries/ironmansuit).

# Troubleshooting & Common Errors
* If you encounter a 'permission denied' message on Mac OS, you might have to change the permissions of the executable file to 711. Once this is over, you will have to go to `System Preferences -> Security & Privacy` and allow Issue to be 'opened anyway'.
