# Issue
Sometimes, if you're feverishly working on a project in your code editor or CLI, it can be **frustrating as hell** to keep switching to the browser to view task requirements in your issue tracker.

Plus, annoyingly, a lot of issue trackers do not have good support for keyboard shortcuts. You have to use the mouse a lot.

To combat all this, **Issue** is a simple CLI utility for viewing, editing and creating GitLab project issues _(Support for Jira, GitHub and more coming soon!)_.

# Installation
* Clone this repository.
* In the root directory, run `go build -o issue main.go`.
    * Add the current directory path to your `PATH` environment variable.
* Run `issue init` to verify the successful installation!
